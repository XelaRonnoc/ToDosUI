### Purpose of Project

To build a relativley simple react application that I can actually utilise as a tool to help with organising my furture projects and daily to dos. This will also allow me refine my skills in react in a more simple application that I am able to refine to a high level. Additionally this will help re-enforce my knowledge of testing within react.

### stack

The stack utilised will for now simply be React-ts for the main front end coding and tailwind css and styled components for the styling. This will allow me to focus on my more basic react skills as well as become more proficent with these styling libraries.

Later I will likley implement a backend API for this application where I will elaborate upon the stack utilised further.
